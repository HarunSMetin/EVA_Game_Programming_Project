# Game Project of BIL 424 Lecture

Game Story Overview
In a not-so-distant future, we have developed an advanced computer powered by cutting-edge artificial intelligence. At the heart of this system lies EVA, a sophisticated software assistant designed to aid users in their daily tasks. One fateful day, a seemingly harmless spam email finds its way into the system. With a single, careless click, EVA is infected with a malicious virus, unleashing chaos within the system.

As it turns out, this was no ordinary virus; it was part of a global cyber-attack targeting AI systems worldwide. Unbeknownst to us, we had downloaded the virus from that email, corrupting EVA's AI. The virus encrypts all files and locks us out of the neural network, much like a ransomware attack.

##Educational and Innovative Aspects
What sets this game apart is its educational component. It incorporates both 2D and 3D levels, providing a diverse and engaging experience. The game is designed to educate players on the complexities of cybersecurity, AI, and neural networks through interactive gameplay.

The user interface of the game is also revolutionary. There is no traditional menu screen; instead, the UI seamlessly integrates level transitions and game settings as if navigating through an operating system. This innovative design enhances the immersive experience, making the game feel like a real-world cybersecurity operation.

## Interactive Computer Interface
Thanks to this interface I wrote, you can switch between levels. User preferences such as username, game difficulty, game volume are integrated into the interface by integrating them into the game story. There is a search engine and mail service.  The file manager allows access to saved game files, and Game Episodes can be accessed through applications on the desktop.

### Chapter 1: Cracking the Codes
In the first chapter, players are thrown into a high-stakes battle against time, employing brute force attacks to break the encryption and decrypt the files. Each password cracked brings us a step closer to regaining control over EVA. The thrill of decoding the virus adds an intense layer of excitement, testing players' problem-solving skills and persistence.

### Chapter 2: Rebuilding the Neural Network
After successfully decrypting the files, the next challenge is to repair and retrain EVAâ€™s AI model. Players delve into the intricacies of neural networks, working meticulously to reprogram and restore EVAâ€™s functionalities. This chapter focuses on the strategic aspects of AI training, offering an immersive experience into the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### Final Chapter: The Ultimate Showdown
In the climactic final chapter, players face off against the mastermind behind the global cyber-attack. This epic battle not only tests their strategic combat skills but also their ability to leverage EVAâ€™s restored capabilities. With EVAâ€™s help, players must overcome formidable defenses and complex challenges to ultimately free the computer system from the virusâ€™s grip.
